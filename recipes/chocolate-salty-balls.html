        <h1>Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls Recipe</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            I have always tried to keep this blog kid-friendly, but this is one of those things I just can't avoid forever. In
            honor of Isaac Hayes, I decided to create a Chocolate Salty Balls recipe using the ingredients from the song. I
            apologize in advance for any offense. Parents, please forgive me, and avert your children's eyes if you must. If
            you've been doing your job your kid won't get the joke anyway. South Park has always been a very controversial show,
            with topics that range from offensive to just plain disgusting. But, unlike many other similar television cartoon
            shows (I won't name which) it actually always has something to say, though the message may not be agreeable for
            everyone. Throughout it's 17 seasons the show has slowly evolved from a silly immature cartoon into a genuine
            satire, with honest and occasionally virtuous messages imbedded amongst the crude humor. Additional to decent
            writing, it has won the respect of many nerds everywhere with detailed references to such geeky things as World of
            Warcraft, Batman and Star Trek. One week from today is the three year anniversary of the death of Isaac Hayes, a
            talented and influential soul singer, and the man who voiced the beloved South Park character called Chef. Chef was
            the portly and promiscuous cafeteria cook for the first 10 seasons of the show. As one one of the more kind and
            down-to-earth characters, his advice was often sought by the four protagonists... though his advice generally
            manifested itself in totally inappropriate and non-relevant soul songs. The recipe I have for you today comes from
            one of those comedic misguided soul songs, probably the most popular song from the show, titled "Chocolate Salty
            Balls." You can listen here, or read here, but I warn you it's totally NSFW (or for the squeamish, or easily
            offended, OR children). The song basically describes a recipe for a salty spherical pastry to um, well... to suck
            on. Despite the obvious metaphor here, I thought a salty chocolate pastry sounded pretty darn good... and guess
            what? I was right! Chef's balls are delicious!

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2/3 cup salted butter</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup brandy</li>
            <li>4 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon table salt</li>
            <li>Coarse sea salt, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a saucepan, bring the butter, sugar and brandy to a boil, stirring constantly.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat. Stir (with a wooden spoon) in 2 cups of chocolate chips until melted. </li>
            <li>Remember to give that spoon a lick! Cool mixture slightly.</li>
            <li>Stir in vanilla. In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs. Gradually add the chocolate mixture and mix
                well.</li>
            <li>Combine the flour, baking soda, cinnamon and salt, then gradually add the dry ingredients to the
                chocolate mixture.</li>
            <li>Stir in any remaining chocolate chips. Spread into a greased baking pan.</li>
            <li>Bake at 325 degrees for 35-45 minutes or until a fork inserted in the center comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Careful not to burn your balls! Let cool just enough that it won't burn your hands.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile set up a small plate or cutting board with some of the sea salt on it.</li>
            <li>Scrape up the brownie mix, working around the edges. You don't want to use the hard edges for the balls.
            </li>
            <li>Begin shaping 1â€³ balls out of the mix, give or take in size. Roll the balls in the salt.</li>
            <li>Do this very lightly (I suggest you do NOT try to emulate the picture), a little sea salt goes a very
                long way.</li>
            <li>If you do happen to oversalt, just brush the excess salt crystals off. Too much salt is bad, mmmkay?
            </li>
            <li>You're done, put 'em in your mouth and suck 'em!</li>
        </ol>
