        <h1>Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls Recipe</h1>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2/3 cup salted butter</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup brandy</li>
            <li>4 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon table salt</li>
            <li>Coarse sea salt, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a saucepan, bring the butter, sugar and brandy to a boil, stirring constantly.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat. Stir (with a wooden spoon) in 2 cups of chocolate chips until melted. </li>
            <li>Remember to give that spoon a lick! Cool mixture slightly.</li>
            <li>Stir in vanilla. In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs. Gradually add the chocolate mixture and mix
                well.</li>
            <li>Combine the flour, baking soda, cinnamon and salt, then gradually add the dry ingredients to the
                chocolate mixture.</li>
            <li>Stir in any remaining chocolate chips. Spread into a greased baking pan.</li>
            <li>Bake at 325 degrees for 35-45 minutes or until a fork inserted in the center comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Careful not to burn your balls! Let cool just enough that it won't burn your hands.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile set up a small plate or cutting board with some of the sea salt on it.</li>
            <li>Scrape up the brownie mix, working around the edges. You don't want to use the hard edges for the balls.
            </li>
            <li>Begin shaping 1â€³ balls out of the mix, give or take in size. Roll the balls in the salt.</li>
            <li>Do this very lightly (I suggest you do NOT try to emulate the picture), a little sea salt goes a very
                long way.</li>
            <li>If you do happen to oversalt, just brush the excess salt crystals off. Too much salt is bad, mmmkay?
            </li>
            <li>You're done, put 'em in your mouth and suck 'em!</li>
        </ol>
